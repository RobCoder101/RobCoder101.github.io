    <td>Previously, I had compacted the Caesar Cipher spreadsheet into a single cell using a Javascript function. This week, I wanted to do it without using Javascript. I started by creating the 'deconcatenator' in a single cell, that used an array to make the cells following it display the correct values. Then, when I decided to explore arrays more, I found a system that would create a list of numbers in seperate cells from 1 to whatever number you chose.</td>

    <td>At this point, I was having to explore the Google Sheets functions menu until I found something interesting. I think that what limited me was not me not working hard enough, but stuck for ideas.</td>
