    <td>Because of the method I used to encode my messages, modifying ASCII codes instead of using a VLOOKUP, I was able to make the decode system very quickly by copying and pasting my existing system, and changing one value.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Unfortunately our teacher was not around, so we temporarily joined the other class, and since they had not started on their Caesar Ciphers yet, we had to watch how to make a Caesar Cipher from the beginning.</td>

    <td>Next time I will add even more functionality when I complete the main task.</td>
